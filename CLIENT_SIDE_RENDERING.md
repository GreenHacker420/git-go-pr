# Client-Side Rendering Fix

## Problem
The leaderboard was using **Server-Side Generation (SSG)** - Astro was fetching data at build time and pre-rendering the HTML. This meant:
- ❌ Data only updated when you redeployed
- ❌ New users logging in wouldn't appear until manual redeploy
- ❌ Stale data persisted for hours/days

## Solution
Converted the leaderboard to **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** - now the page:
- ✅ Fetches data fresh on every page load
- ✅ Always shows the latest users and PR counts
- ✅ No redeployment needed when data updates
- ✅ Real-time updates whenever users visit the page

## Changes Made

### Before (SSG - Server-Side Generation):
```astro
---
// Fetches at BUILD TIME (once during deployment)
const res = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/leaderboard`);
const leaderboard = await res.json();
---

<!-- Data is "baked" into HTML at build time -->
<div>{leaderboard[0].username}</div>
```

### After (CSR - Client-Side Rendering):
```astro
---
// No build-time fetch
---

<!-- Empty containers -->
<div id="leaderboard-table"></div>

<script>
  // Fetches at PAGE LOAD TIME (every time user visits)
  async function loadLeaderboard() {
    const res = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/leaderboard`);
    const leaderboard = await res.json();
    // Populate HTML dynamically
  }
  loadLeaderboard();
</script>
```

## Benefits

1. **Always Fresh Data** - Users see the latest leaderboard without manual intervention
2. **No Redeploy Needed** - Backend updates automatically reflected on frontend
3. **Better UX** - Loading spinner shows while fetching data
4. **Error Handling** - Graceful error messages if backend is down
5. **Auto-Refresh** - Just reload the page to see latest data

## Trade-offs

- **SEO**: Search engines might not index the leaderboard content (but this is admin/user data, not marketing content)
- **Performance**: Tiny delay on page load while fetching (but data is more important than speed here)
- **Initial Load**: Blank screen replaced with loading spinner

## How It Works Now

1. User visits `/leaderboard`
2. Page loads with empty containers + loading spinner
3. JavaScript fetches fresh data from Railway backend
4. Data is rendered dynamically into the page
5. Podium and table appear with latest rankings

## Testing

Test the fix by:
1. Deploying to Vercel (wait 2-3 minutes)
2. Visit the leaderboard page
3. Have a new user log in
4. Refresh the leaderboard page (Cmd+R)
5. New user should appear immediately! ✅

No more manual redeployments needed! 🎉
